Implements an ML module with visible/invisible separation for polynomials which includes the following:

o Type definition for a tuple which contains the coefficient and exponent of a polynomial term (for example the tuple (3,4) represents 3x^4)

o Set of functions to find the derivative of a polynomial where the polynomial is represented as a list of tuples and writes the derivative onto a string

So for example if we define val poly:term list=[(2,3),(4,1),(5,0)] which represents 2x^3 + 4x + 5, the derivate functions should return "6x2 + 4".
