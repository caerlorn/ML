The first function takes a list and an integer n as parameter, and returns a list consisting of the first n elements of the list in reverse order.
The second function takes two lists as parameter and performs the following: 
o If the first list is the same length as the second list, returns the first list
o If the first list is shorter than the second list, returns the first list appended by 0’s. The resulting list is as long as the second list.
o If the first list is longer than the second list, returns a portion of the first list which contains as many elements as the second list.
